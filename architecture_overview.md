# Next.js and Supabase E-commerce Application: Architecture Overview

This document outlines the architecture and folder structure for a full-featured e-commerce web application built using Next.js for the frontend and Supabase as the backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform. This combination provides a powerful, scalable, and modern stack for developing a rich user experience and robust backend functionalities.

## 1. Overall Architecture

The application will follow a client-server architecture where the Next.js application serves as the client-side and server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) framework, interacting with Supabase for all backend operations. Supabase will provide database services (PostgreSQL), authentication, real-time subscriptions, and storage.

**Key Components:**

*   **Next.js Frontend:** Responsible for rendering the user interface, handling user interactions, managing client-side state, and communicating with Supabase. It will leverage Next.js features like App Router (or Pages Router depending on the version and preference, though App Router is the modern standard), server components, client components, API routes (for any specific backend logic not directly handled by Supabase client libraries), and image optimization.
*   **Supabase Backend:** Provides a comprehensive suite of backend services:
    *   **Database (PostgreSQL):** Stores all application data, including products, categories, users, orders, and shopping cart information. We will define a clear schema and utilize Supabase's auto-generated APIs for data manipulation.
    *   **Authentication:** Manages user registration, login (email/password, social logins), and session management. Supabase Auth integrates seamlessly with its database using Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
    *   **Storage:** Used for storing product images and potentially other static assets.
    *   **Realtime:** Can be leveraged for features like live order status updates or real-time inventory changes.
    *   **Edge Functions (Optional):** For custom server-side logic that might be too complex or sensitive to run directly in the client or via Supabase client libraries (e.g., integrating with third-party services like payment gateways if direct client-side integration is not preferred or secure enough for certain operations).

**Interaction Flow:**

1.  Users access the e-commerce site through their browser.
2.  The Next.js application serves the frontend pages (either pre-rendered or server-rendered).
3.  Client-side interactions (e.g., adding to cart, logging in) trigger API calls or direct interactions with Supabase services using the Supabase JavaScript client library.
4.  Supabase handles authentication, data queries, and storage operations, returning data to the Next.js application.
5.  The Next.js application updates the UI based on the received data.
6.  For payment processing, the frontend will integrate with Stripe and PayPal, potentially using Supabase Edge Functions as an intermediary for secure handling of sensitive operations if needed, or client-side SDKs where appropriate.

This architecture aims for a decoupled frontend and backend, allowing for independent development and scaling. The use of Supabase simplifies backend development significantly by providing managed services.



## 2. Next.js Frontend Folder Structure

A well-organized folder structure is crucial for maintainability and scalability. We will adopt a feature-based or domain-based structure within the Next.js `app` directory (assuming App Router usage). This approach groups related components, pages, and logic together, making the codebase easier to navigate and understand.

**Explanation of Key Directories:**

*   **/app:** Core of the Next.js application using the App Router. Route groups `(auth)`, `(checkout)`, `(main)`, `(user)` are used to organize routes without affecting the URL path, allowing for different layouts or functionalities for these sections.
    *   **Dynamic routes** like `[slug]` for products and `[orderId]` for orders allow for clean URLs.
    *   **/api:** For any backend logic that needs to run on the server, such as handling webhooks from payment gateways or specific server-to-server communication that cannot be directly managed by the Supabase client.
*   **/components:** Contains reusable UI components, categorized by feature or domain (e.g., `products`, `cart`, `common`). This promotes modularity and code reuse.
*   **/contexts:** For managing global state using React Context API. For instance, `AuthContext` could manage user authentication state, and `CartContext` could manage the shopping cart.
*   **/hooks:** Custom React hooks to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic (e.g., `useAuth` for authentication-related actions, `useProductSearch` for product filtering logic).
*   **/lib:** Utility functions, configuration files, and client initializations. `supabaseClient.ts` will configure and export the Supabase JS client. Similarly, clients or helper functions for Stripe and PayPal would reside here.
*   **/public:** Static assets that are served directly, like favicons or marketing images not tied to specific products.
*   **/styles:** Global stylesheets and Tailwind CSS configuration.
*   **/types:** TypeScript type definitions for data structures used throughout the application (e.g., `Product`, `User`, `Order`).

This structure provides a clear separation of concerns and is designed to scale as the application grows in complexity.

## 3. Supabase Integration

Supabase will be the backbone for our backend services. Integration will primarily occur through the `supabase-js` client library within the Next.js application.

**Key Integration Points:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   The Supabase client will be initialized in `/lib/supabaseClient.ts` using environment variables for the Supabase URL and anon key (public key).
    *   This client instance will be used throughout the application to interact with Supabase services.

2.  **Authentication:**
    *   Supabase Auth will handle user registration (email/password, potentially social logins like Google, GitHub), login, logout, password recovery, and session management.
    *   Frontend components in `/app/(auth)/` and `/components/auth/` will use the Supabase client for these operations.
    *   User sessions and JWTs provided by Supabase will be managed, potentially using React Context (`AuthContext`) to make user state available globally.
    *   Row Level Security (RLS) policies will be configured in the Supabase dashboard to protect data, ensuring users can only access and modify data they are permitted to.

3.  **Database (PostgreSQL):**
    *   **Schema Design:** We will define tables for `products`, `categories`, `users` (managed by Supabase Auth but can be extended with a `profiles` table), `orders`, `order_items`, `cart`, `cart_items`, etc. Relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many) will be established using foreign keys.
    *   **Data Access:** The Next.js application will query and mutate data using the Supabase client library. This includes fetching product lists, product details, creating orders, managing user profiles, etc.
    *   **Server Components & API Routes:** For data fetching, Next.js Server Components can directly interact with Supabase. For mutations or sensitive operations, API Routes or Supabase Edge Functions might be used, though many operations can be securely performed client-side with appropriate RLS policies.
    *   **Realtime (Optional):** Supabase Realtime can be used to listen for database changes. For example, an admin dashboard could show new orders in real-time, or product stock levels could update across user sessions.

4.  **Storage:**
    *   Supabase Storage will be used to store product images and potentially other user-generated content.
    *   When admins add or update products, images will be uploaded to a designated Supabase bucket.
    *   RLS policies will also be applied to storage buckets to control access (e.g., public read for product images, restricted write access for admins).
    *   The Next.js application will fetch image URLs from Supabase Storage to display them in the frontend.

5.  **Edge Functions (Optional but Recommended for Payments):**
    *   For operations requiring server-side execution beyond simple data fetching or for interacting securely with third-party APIs (like payment gateways), Supabase Edge Functions (written in TypeScript/JavaScript) can be deployed.
    *   For example, creating a payment intent with Stripe or finalizing a PayPal transaction might involve an Edge Function to keep secret keys and sensitive logic off the client.

**Environment Variables:**

Supabase URL, anon key, service role key (for server-side operations or Edge Functions if needed), and any third-party API keys (Stripe, PayPal) will be stored in `.env.local` and accessed via `process.env` in Next.js.

## 4. Mapping Core E-commerce Features

Here’s how the requested e-commerce features will be implemented within this Next.js and Supabase architecture:

*   **Product Management:**
    *   **Categories/Subcategories:** Managed in a `categories` table in Supabase. Admins will manage these via the `/admin/categories` section. Products will have a foreign key to the `categories` table.
    *   **Product Attributes:** Stored in a `products` table (name, description, price, SKU, stock quantity). Images will be handled via Supabase Storage, with URLs or references stored in the `products` table or a related `product_images` table.
    *   **Search & Filtering:** Implemented on the frontend (`/products` page, `/search` page). Client-side filtering for basic criteria. For complex keyword search, Supabase’s PostgreSQL full-text search capabilities can be leveraged, or queries can be constructed using `ilike` for partial matches. Filtering by category and price range will involve querying the `products` table with appropriate `WHERE` clauses.

*   **User Accounts:**
    *   **Registration/Login/Profile:** Handled by Supabase Auth. Frontend components in `/app/(auth)/` and `/app/(user)/profile/` will interact with Supabase. A `profiles` table linked to `auth.users` can store additional user information.
    *   **User Roles (Customers/Admins):** A `role` field can be added to the `profiles` table or managed via custom claims in Supabase Auth. RLS policies will enforce access control based on these roles.

*   **Shopping Cart & Checkout:**
    *   **Add/Update/Remove:** Cart state can be managed client-side (e.g., using `CartContext` and `localStorage` for persistence for guest users) or server-side in a `carts` and `cart_items` table in Supabase, especially for logged-in users to enable cross-device cart persistence.
    *   **Checkout Process:** Multi-step process in `/app/(checkout)/` (cart review, shipping, payment). Shipping address and contact info will be collected and stored, potentially in the `orders` table or a related `shipping_addresses` table linked to users.

*   **Payment Integration (Stripe & PayPal):**
    *   Frontend components will use Stripe.js/PayPal SDKs for collecting payment information securely (PCI compliance handled by the gateways).
    *   Server-side logic (potentially Supabase Edge Functions or Next.js API routes) will handle creating payment intents (Stripe) or setting up transactions (PayPal), and confirming payments.
    *   Order confirmation will update the `orders` table status.

*   **Order Management:**
    *   **User View:** Users can view their order history and status in `/app/(user)/orders/`. This will fetch data from the `orders` and `order_items` tables.
    *   **Admin View:** Admins manage orders (view, update status, etc.) in `/admin/orders/`. This will involve CRUD operations on the `orders` table and potentially trigger inventory updates.

*   **Admin Dashboard:**
    *   Located under `/admin/`. Access restricted to users with the 'admin' role.
    *   **Product/Category Management:** CRUD operations on `products` and `categories` tables.
    *   **Order Management:** As described above.
    *   **User Management:** Admins might view user lists and potentially manage roles (if applicable) via the `profiles` table or Supabase Auth admin capabilities.

*   **Responsive Design:**
    *   Achieved using Tailwind CSS, which is a utility-first CSS framework excellent for building responsive layouts. All components and pages will be designed with mobile-first principles.

This detailed mapping ensures that all required functionalities are covered by the chosen architecture, leveraging the strengths of both Next.js and Supabase.
